# Info about export and imports

* two types of exports and imports
   - default export and import
   - named export and import

* Default import and export
  - Just write export default Component_name;
  - while importing just import it without curly braces
  - It is used when we have to exoprt only one thing from a file. If we want export multiple thing then named export and import must be used

* Export import and export
  - when we have to export multiple things from a file in a component then we can't use default export it will give error. In this case we use Named export.
  - Wriite export keyword before a variable, E.G - export const LOGO_URL = "https//.xyz_abc.com"
  - While importing named exports we have to use curly brackets, E.G - import {Named_exports} from "../xyz/abc"
